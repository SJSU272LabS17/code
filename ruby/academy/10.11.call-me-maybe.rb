Call Me Maybe

Nice work! Calling a proc with a method isn't too tricky. However, there's an even easier way.
Unlike blocks, we can call procs directly by using Ruby's .call method. Check it out!

test = Proc.new { # does something }
test.call
# does that something!

Remember: there's always more than one way to do something in Ruby.

Go ahead and create a proc called hi that puts "Hello!", then .call it!

=end

hi = Proc.new { puts "Hello!" }
hi.call
